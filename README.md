\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Mining Guardian\
\
Mining Guardian is an automated monitoring and remediation system for bitcoin mining operations.\
\
The system scans a mining network through AMS (Miner Management System), checks miner telemetry against defined operational policies, and recommends corrective actions when parameters fall outside approved ranges.\
\
When integrated with OpenClaw, operators can review and approve remediation actions before they are applied.\
\
This creates a controlled automation layer for managing large mining fleets.\
\

\
## Key Features\
\
\'95 Automated miner monitoring  \
\'95 Policy-based parameter validation  \
\'95 Recommended remediation actions  \
\'95 Human approval workflow  \
\'95 Controlled automated fixes  \
\'95 Integration with AMS miner management systems\
\
---\
\
## How It Works\
\
Mining Guardian operates as a policy engine between the mining fleet and the automation layer.\
\
Miners send telemetry to AMS.  \
Mining Guardian retrieves that data through the AMS API and evaluates it against operational rules.\
\
If a miner falls outside defined parameters, the system:\
\
1. Detects the violation\
2. Generates a recommended fix\
3. Requests operator approval\
4. Applies the fix through AMS\
\
---\
\
## Example Use Cases\
\
Mining Guardian can detect conditions such as:\
\
\'95 Low hashrate  \
\'95 Excessive chip temperature  \
\'95 Incorrect power profile  \
\'95 Pool configuration errors  \
\'95 Firmware version drift\
\
Example corrective actions include:\
\
\'95 Applying a safe power profile  \
\'95 Restarting an unstable miner  \
\'95 Enabling backup pool settings  \
\'95 Flagging miners for operator review\

\
## Installation\
\
Clone the repository:\
\
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mining-guardian.git\
\
Move into the project directory:\
\
cd mining-guardian\
\
Install required Python packages:\
\
pip install requests\
\
---\
\
## Running the Program\
\
Run the guardian service:\
\
python openclaw_mining_guardian.py\
\
The program will:\
\
1. Scan miners from AMS\
2. Evaluate operational rules\
3. Generate findings\
4. Recommend fixes\
5. Apply approved actions\

\
Future components may include:\
\

OpenClaw integration  \
smart PDU telemetry integration\
\
---\
\
## Safety Model\
\
Mining Guardian uses a human-in-the-loop design.\
\
Recommended actions are reviewed before being executed to prevent unsafe automated changes in production mining environments.\
\
---\
\
## Future Development\
\
Planned improvements include:\
\
\'95 smart PDU integration  \
\'95 predictive miner failure detection  \
\'95 automated performance optimization  \
\'95 fleet-level analytics  }
