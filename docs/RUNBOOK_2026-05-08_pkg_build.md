# Runbook — 2026-05-08 — Build, sign, notarize, and staple `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg`

**Audience:** future-Bobby (or any operator) verifying which pkg corresponds to which `main` commit, plus any agent reading the pkg state at session start.
**Scope:** **build receipt for the post-P-031 v1.0.3 .pkg.** This is NOT the comprehensive build-from-scratch runbook — for that, see `docs/RUNBOOK_2026-04-28_pkg_build.md` and `docs/RUNBOOK_PKG_REBUILD.md`. This file is the audit trail for the build that happened on 2026-05-08.

## What this build contains (delta from the prior build on the Mini)

The Mini is currently running `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-b6ecb6a7c0ee.pkg`
(post-P-028). This new build adds the four PRs merged on 2026-05-08:

| PR | P-NN | Headline |
|----|------|----------|
| #162 | P-030 | scanner: add `ai/` to early `sys.path` so `run_once()` resolves `knowledge_manager` |
| #163 | P-032 | discovery-sink: chmod atomic-write tmp file to 0664 before replace |
| #164 | P-029 (knowledge) | installer: ship baseline `knowledge.json` (3.74 MB, SHA-256 prefix `2edea974d711`, 96 profiles / 133 fingerprints / 61 insights) in payload; D-29 locked |
| #165 | P-031 | scanner+ai+installer: resolve Ollama model from env, drop never-pulled `qwen2.5:32b` fallback |

For the full PR-by-PR detail, see
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2026-05-08_P030_P032_P029_P031_DAY_LOG.md`.

## Why the build had to be invoked from the Mac Terminal directly

The agent bridge in this session could exec arbitrary commands on
the agent's sandbox (Linux), but could not exec `pkgbuild` /
`productbuild` / `codesign` / `xcrun notarytool` against the build
Mac. Bobby's Mac was reachable for read-side operations (file
list, log read, git operations), but not for the pkg toolchain.
This is consistent with prior weeks; the build path has always
required Bobby's Mac. Captured here so future sessions don't try
to delegate `pkgbuild` to the bridge.

---

## Pre-install verification (paste-along on the Mini or build Mac)

Before installing on the Mini, all of these must succeed. **Stop
and do not install if any of the four checks fails.**

```bash
# 1. SHA-256 must match the sidecar.
cd /Users/BigBobby/Documents/GitHub/Mining-Guardian/build
shasum -a 256 MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg
cat MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg.sha256
# Both must print:
#   dbe5c653ec375eec696df3538aef8d7525d852f1f7e5a4795162f7c836fe49ec
```

```bash
# 2. Pkg must be signed by the trusted Developer ID Installer cert
#    AND notarized by Apple. pkgutil walks the chain.
pkgutil --check-signature MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg
# Expected output includes:
#   Status: signed by a developer certificate issued by Apple for distribution
#   Notarization: trusted by the Apple notary service
#   Signed Time: 2026-05-08 18:10:51 +0000
#   1. Developer ID Installer: Robert Fiesler (ARJZ5FYU94)
```

```bash
# 3. Stapler must validate the notarization ticket embedded in the pkg.
xcrun stapler validate MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg
# Expected: The validate action worked!
```

```bash
# 4. Gatekeeper must accept the pkg as Notarized Developer ID.
spctl --assess -t install -v MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg
# Expected: accepted
#           source=Notarized Developer ID
```

If any of the four returns a different value, **stop**. Do not
install. The pkg may have been modified or rebuilt since the
build above.

---

## Install on the Mini (paste-along)

Once all four pre-install checks pass:

```bash
# 1. Copy the pkg + sidecar to the Mini (Tailscale or USB, operator's choice).
#    Example via Tailscale (Bobby's Mac → Mini):
scp /Users/BigBobby/Documents/GitHub/Mining-Guardian/build/MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg \
    /Users/BigBobby/Documents/GitHub/Mining-Guardian/build/MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg.sha256 \
    miningguardian@100.69.66.32:/tmp/

# 2. On the Mini, re-verify SHA-256 matches the sidecar.
ssh miningguardian@100.69.66.32 'cd /tmp && shasum -a 256 -c MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg.sha256'
# Expected: MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg: OK

# 3. On the Mini, re-verify Gatekeeper still accepts (in case of in-flight tampering).
ssh miningguardian@100.69.66.32 'spctl --assess -t install -v /tmp/MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg'
# Expected: accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID

# 4. On the Mini, install.
ssh miningguardian@100.69.66.32 'sudo installer -pkg /tmp/MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg -target /'
# Expected: rc=0
```

---

## Post-install verification (paste-along on the Mini)

Run these after the `installer` command returns rc=0:

```bash
# A. Postinstall log markers (P-029 knowledge upgrade branch).
sudo grep -E 'P-029: preserved existing runtime knowledge.json' \
  /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/logs/install.log
# Expected: exactly one line.

sudo grep -E 'P-029: staged packaged seed' \
  /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/logs/install.log
# Expected: exactly one line referencing
#   incoming/knowledge-seed-1.0.3-eecde3a.json
```

```bash
# B. .env contains OLLAMA_URL + OLLAMA_MODEL (P-031).
sudo grep -E '^OLLAMA_URL=|^OLLAMA_MODEL=' \
  /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/.env
# Expected:
#   OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate
#   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b              (16 GB tier)   OR
#   OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q4_K_M   (24 GB+ tier per D-13)
```

```bash
# C. config.json has the env: placeholders (P-031).
sudo python3 -c '
import json
with open("/Library/Application Support/MiningGuardian/config.json") as f:
    c = json.load(f)
print("ollama_url   =", c.get("ollama_url"))
print("ollama_model =", c.get("ollama_model"))
'
# Expected:
#   ollama_url   = env:OLLAMA_URL
#   ollama_model = env:OLLAMA_MODEL
```

```bash
# D. All 10 services loaded; none exit-127-looping.
sudo launchctl list | grep com.miningguardian | wc -l
# Expected: at least 10 (10 services + 11 scheduled-job plists may
# also appear; counter inclusive of both).
sudo launchctl print system/com.miningguardian.scanner | head -40
# Expected: 'last exit code = 0' or 'pid = <nonzero>' (running).
```

After at least one full scan completes (give it ~5 minutes after
install for the first scan window):

```bash
# E. discovery sink at 0664 (P-032).
stat -f '%Lp %N' \
  /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/cron_tracking/scanner_discovery/latest_findings.json
# Expected: 664 ...latest_findings.json
# Repeat after a second scan; the value must NOT drift back to 600.
```

```bash
# F. No knowledge_manager import error (P-030).
sudo grep -E 'Knowledge update skipped|No module named .knowledge_manager.' \
  /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/logs/guardian.log
# Expected: no matches on any timestamp newer than the install.
```

```bash
# G. No Ollama 404 error (P-031).
sudo grep -E 'Qwen scan analysis failed: HTTP Error 404' \
  /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/logs/guardian.log
# Expected: no matches on any timestamp newer than the install.
```

```bash
# H. No Permission denied in scanner stderr.
sudo grep -E 'Permission denied' \
  /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/logs/scanner.err.log
# Expected: no matches.
```

If A through H all return the expected values, the install is
green and the four PRs merged today have all taken effect on the
Mini.

---

## Catalog parity audit (run after install — gates ROBS-PC / VPS decommissioning)

Per the weekend audit-and-migrate strategy, ROBS-PC and the VPS
stay up until the Mini's catalog has parity with the canonical
post-cutover state. Run this on the Mini once SSH access is
restored or by the operator directly:

```bash
sudo docker exec mining-guardian-db psql -U mg_catalog -d mining_guardian_catalog -c "
  SELECT 'miner_models'   AS t, COUNT(*) FROM hardware.miner_models
  UNION ALL SELECT 'model_aliases',  COUNT(*) FROM hardware.model_aliases
  UNION ALL SELECT 'manufacturers',  COUNT(*) FROM hardware.manufacturers
  UNION ALL SELECT 'sources',        COUNT(*) FROM hardware.sources
  UNION ALL SELECT 'contributors',   COUNT(*) FROM hardware.contributors
  UNION ALL SELECT 'field_registry', COUNT(*) FROM hardware.field_registry
;"
```

Expected baselines:

| Table | Expected count |
|---|---|
| `hardware.miner_models` | 320 |
| `hardware.model_aliases` | 14338 |
| `hardware.manufacturers` | 17 |
| `hardware.sources` | 15 |
| `hardware.contributors` | 1 |
| `hardware.field_registry` | 0 (intentional baseline) |

If all six match, parity is proven and ROBS-PC / VPS can be
decommissioned in a separate, deliberate session. If any value
differs, **stop** and do not decommission — the canonical copy on
ROBS-PC + the historical archive on the VPS remain the safety net.

## Post-build update (2026-05-08 evening)

The `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg` documented above was
**installed on the customer Mini** later the same day. Build stamp
on the Mini matches `eecde3a94c5bfb3e102d50596eb25a1b447e7356`.
Post-install verification passed every gate — see
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2026-05-08.md` "Post-install verification on
the Mini" for the full list (knowledge.json size + sha + profile
counts; OLLAMA env / config.json correct; scanner completed and
persisted to Postgres; `latest_findings.json` mode 0664).

Two new latent bugs surfaced live-only (the test suite did not catch
them) and were fixed and merged the same day as **PR #168** (P-034
Qwen scan path + P-035 KnowledgeManager `total_flags` backfill +
writer-race sweep across 7 sites), squash `33bac6f` on merge
`1327060`. **PR #167** (P-034-only) was closed as superseded by #168;
no code from #167 reached `main`.

PR #168 is **pure Python source** — no installer, payload,
postinstall, plist, schema, migration, or notarization changes. As a
result this `eecde3a` package remains a valid distribution artifact
and **was NOT regenerated**. The package on the Mini is the same one
documented above (SHA-256 still
`dbe5c653ec375eec696df3538aef8d7525d852f1f7e5a4795162f7c836fe49ec`).

The decision matrix for delivering the P-034 + P-035 fix to the Mini
(git pull vs. rebuild from `main` 1327060) is in
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2026-05-08.md` under "Next exact steps". For
fresh-install media for the next customer Mini, a rebuild from `main`
1327060 is the recommended step so the new build does not ship with
the same drift.

---

## Late afternoon update (2026-05-08) — `2b41764` rebuild + Mini install + B-45 / P-036 surfaced

After the eecde3a-based audit above, the operator decided to deliver
P-034 + P-035 to the Mini via a fresh package rebuild (Outcome B in
the handoff decision matrix), since the install tree on the Mini is
not git-managed (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` returned
`not_git`). The rebuild ran from main commit `2b41764` (the merge
commit for PR #166 / docs handoff), which had `33bac6f` (P-034 +
P-035) as a direct ancestor.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source `main` commit | `2b41764` (full SHA `2b417642121b...`) |
| Source `main` commit message | `Merge pull request #166 from robertfiesler-spec/docs/handoff-2026-05-08-pkg-build` |
| Pkg path on build Mac | `build/MiningGuardian-1.0.3-2b41764a121b.pkg` |
| Pkg SHA-256 (corrected sidecar) | `463ca8d69d4e86ed9be96a76432628f83ee34f00b0764edad73a2c7f85b67387` |
| Notarization | submitted, accepted, stapled, validated |
| Gatekeeper | `spctl --assess -t install -v` → accepted (Notarized Developer ID) |
| Install on Mini | `installer -pkg ... -target /` rc=0 |
| Build stamp on Mini | `version=1.0.3 / git_sha=2b41764a121b / stamped_utc=2026-05-08T20:18:17Z` |

**Note on the SHA-256 sidecar:** the sidecar had to be **regenerated**
(the first sidecar value did not match the actual pkg bytes once the
final stapled artifact was on disk). The corrected sidecar value
above is the only one to use; do not refer to any earlier value as
canonical.

### Postinstall behavior on the Mini (2b41764 build)

All as designed:

- preserved the existing runtime `knowledge.json` (upgrade branch),
- staged the packaged seed under
  `${MG_INSTALL_ROOT}/knowledge/incoming/knowledge-seed-1.0.3-2b41764a121b.json`
  (deterministic name — short SHA matches the build),
- reconciled the Postgres `mg` role and re-verified TCP auth,
- preserved `config.json`,
- finished cleanly.

### What the first scan after install proved (P-034 / P-035 working)

The first post-install scan ran with **exit code 0** and persisted
to Postgres. Logs confirmed every earlier-today fix took effect:

- ❌ `Errno 2 No such file or directory: '/root/Mining-Guardian/knowledge.json.tmp'` — gone (P-034)
- ❌ `Knowledge update skipped: 'total_flags'` — gone (P-035 backfill)
- ❌ `No module named 'knowledge_manager'` — gone (P-030 sys.path)
- ❌ `Qwen scan analysis failed: HTTP Error 404` — gone (P-031 model resolver)
- ✅ `INFO llm_scan_analyses written` lines now appear; the canonical
  file's `llm_scan_analyses` array reached 176 entries — Vision
  Anchor 1's training stream is finally accumulating.

### The new failure mode the same scan exposed (B-45 / P-036)

P-035's `core.file_lock.locked_knowledge_update` and
`atomic_write_json` create a temp file in the parent directory of
the path they were given and call `os.replace(tmp, path)`. When
`path` is the P-029 compat symlink at
`${MG_INSTALL_ROOT}/knowledge.json`, POSIX `rename` overwrites the
**symlink** with a regular file rather than updating the target.
Every active writer computes its target as `_ROOT / "knowledge.json"`
which in the install layout IS the symlink — so the first writer to
fire after install broke the compat path immediately.

Live observation on the Mini at 15:43 (the same day):

- `${MG_INSTALL_ROOT}/knowledge/knowledge.json` (canonical) —
  intact: 3,739,968 bytes, sha256
  `2edea974d711ac0ca648e796468cdb8ca0779fe32539f97a41b8b2f1a921820c`,
  96 miner_profiles, 133 miner_fingerprints, 176 llm_scan_analyses.
- `${MG_INSTALL_ROOT}/knowledge.json` (was symlink) — replaced by a
  root-owned **regular file of 948 bytes**.
- Reads via canonical path kept working; reads via the compat path
  silently saw a stale 948-byte file. A divergence that would
  compound over time. Vision Anchor 1 risk.

### Manual mitigation applied on the Mini before the next scan window

(Already done — listed here for the audit trail, not as instructions.)

1. Quarantined the bad regular file under
   `${MG_INSTALL_ROOT}/knowledge/quarantine/knowledge-json-regular-file-<timestamp>.json`.
2. Removed the regular file at the symlink path.
3. Recreated the symlink:
   `ln -s knowledge/knowledge.json /Library/Application\ Support/MiningGuardian/knowledge.json`
4. `chown -h miningguardian:staff` on the link.
5. Verified with `ls -la` — leading character is `l` (symlink); the
   canonical file is intact.

### P-036 fix landed on `main` after the mitigation

PR #169 (`mg/p036-knowledge-symlink-preserve-canonical-resolver`,
squash `906fa4a`, merge `fab6694`) was opened, reviewed, and merged
the same evening. The fix routes both `locked_knowledge_update` and
`atomic_write_json` through a new private helper
`_resolve_write_target(path)` that, if the supplied path is a
symlink whose target's parent exists, returns the symlink's target
as the rename destination. The temp file lands in the **target's**
parent and `os.replace` lands on the canonical file, leaving the
symlink itself untouched. The lock file is keyed off the resolved
target so two writers — one given the symlink, one given the
canonical path — serialize against the same flock.

Tests on `main` at `fab6694`:

- `tests/test_p036_knowledge_symlink_preserve.py` — **9/9 PASS** (new)
- `tests/test_p035_knowledge_persistence_hardening.py` — **26/26 PASS** (no regression)
- `tests/test_p022_discovery_sink.py` — **23/23 OK** (no regression)

### Status of `2b41764` package — superseded for new install media

The `2b41764` package is **operational and installed on the Mini**,
but it lacks the P-036 fix. It is therefore **superseded for new
install media** by the rebuild from `main` at `fab6694`. The
`fab6694` build is the recommended next-install artifact for both
the existing customer Mini (delivers the P-036 fix) and any
fresh-install media for the next customer.

The `2b41764` package and its corrected sidecar should NOT be
regenerated, deleted, or modified — they are the audit trail for
the install that uncovered B-45.

### Resume from here — `fab6694` rebuild + Mini install (paste-along)

The full one-at-a-time resume sequence (build → notarize → staple →
spctl → transfer → install → verify symlink survives the next scan
→ run VPS/ROBS-PC shutdown gates) is in
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2026-05-08.md` under
`⏸ PAUSED EOD 2026-05-08 — read this FIRST before anything else` →
"Resume plan — pick up here in 1–2 hours (one-at-a-time)". That
section is the canonical resume checklist; this runbook is the
build-receipt half of the same story.

## Late evening update (2026-05-08) — `e3461260af2a` package built tonight

After PR #170 (PM pause docs handoff) merged as `e346126`, the
operator built the post-P-036 .pkg from the latest `main` so it would
be ready for tomorrow morning's install. **The package has been
built, signed, notarized, and `spctl`-accepted on the build Mac, but
has NOT been copied to or installed on the Mini yet.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source `main` commit | `e346126` (full SHA `e3461260af2a5cc8b40497a019009c4430a1fa32`) |
| Source `main` commit message | `Merge pull request #170 from robertfiesler-spec/docs/handoff-2026-05-08-pm-p036-mini-paused-eod` |

| Pkg size | ~510 MB |
| Signing identity | `Developer ID Installer: Robert Fiesler (ARJZ5FYU94)` |

| `spctl --assess -t install -v` | `accepted`; source `Notarized Developer ID`; origin `Developer ID Installer: Robert Fiesler (ARJZ5FYU94)` |
| `xcrun stapler validate` (via bridge) | **failed** — CloudKit `NSPOSIXErrorDomain` "Operation not permitted" / "validate action failed Error 68" — bridge-only environmental restriction; not a notarization failure (see below) |
| Installed on Mini | **NOT YET** — copy + install is the first action tomorrow morning |

### What this build contains (delta from what's installed on the Mini)

The Mini is currently running `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-2b41764a121b.pkg`
(post-P-035, lacks P-036). The new `e3461260af2a` package adds
exactly one functional PR over that — **PR #169 (P-036, the
symlink-preserving file_lock fix)** — plus the 2026-05-08 evening
documentation merged in PR #170.

### Bridge stapler caveat — why `spctl` and `pkgutil` are the authoritative gates

The bridge that ran `xcrun stapler validate` against the build Mac
tonight returned a CloudKit `NSPOSIXErrorDomain` error — "Operation
not permitted" / "validate action failed Error 68". That code path
needs CloudKit access permissions the bridge does not have in this
session. **It is NOT a notarization failure:**

- `spctl --assess -t install -v` accepted the pkg as **Notarized
  Developer ID**, with origin `Developer ID Installer: Robert
  Fiesler (ARJZ5FYU94)`.
- `pkgutil --check-signature` reported the package is signed by a
  developer certificate issued by Apple for distribution AND that
  the **notarization is trusted by the Apple notary service**, with
  signed timestamp `2026-05-09 00:31:15 +0000`.

If a clean stapler receipt is desired for the audit trail, the
operator may optionally re-run `xcrun stapler validate
build/MiningGuardian-1.0.3-e3461260af2a.pkg` directly from the Mac
Terminal tomorrow morning — that is not a bridge invocation and is
expected to succeed. **Do not block the install on the bridge
stapler error.** `spctl` and `pkgutil` are the authoritative gates
and both passed.

### Tomorrow morning — exact first actions

Run these from the build Mac tomorrow morning, one at a time. The
canonical step-by-step (with R-1 through R-8) is in
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2026-05-08.md` under "Resume plan — pick up
tomorrow morning (one-at-a-time)". Quick reference:

```bash
# 1. Verify the artifact is intact on the build Mac

```

After R-7 passes, continue to **R-8 — passover audit shutdown
gates** (catalog row counts, Ollama local tags, no traffic to
ROBS-PC `100.110.87.1` or VPS `100.106.123.83`, optional ROBS-PC
staging research dump). All four gates are gated on the
`e3461260af2a` install completing cleanly first.

### Status of `2b41764` package — operational on the Mini until tomorrow morning

The `2b41764` package is **operational on the Mini at pause time**
but lacks P-036. It is **superseded for the next install** by the
`e3461260af2a` package documented above. The `2b41764` artifact and
its corrected sidecar
(`463ca8d69d4e86ed9be96a76432628f83ee34f00b0764edad73a2c7f85b67387`)
should NOT be regenerated, deleted, or modified — they are the
audit trail for the install that uncovered B-45.

### Status of `eecde3a94c5b` package — superseded; do not install

The earlier `eecde3a94c5b` package (post-P-031) is two PRs behind the
new `e3461260af2a` build (it lacks P-034 + P-035 + P-036). It should
not be installed; keep on disk as audit trail only.

## ✅ 2026-05-09 Saturday addendum — final installed-green build `53eac9397f00`

> Appended on 2026-05-09. Everything above this section is historical
> context — the `e3461260af2a` build was superseded by today's
> post-P-037 build before being installed on the Mini.

### Why a second build was needed

Yesterday's `e3461260af2a` package was post-P-036 only. PR #172
(P-037 — owner/mode normalization on canonical knowledge writes)
merged into `main` 2026-05-08 evening as squash `0ea9f4b` on merge
`53eac93`. P-037 is plain-Python only — no installer, payload,
postinstall, plist, schema, migration, or notarization changes —
but the Mini's installed tree is NOT git-managed (`git rev-parse
--is-inside-work-tree` → `not_git`), so delivery to the Mini
required a fresh `.pkg` rebuild. Bundling P-037 into the same
build as P-036 (rather than two separate notarization rounds) was
the cleanest path and is what the operator did this morning.

### Mini self-contained checks — ✅ all passed

```
Ollama tags:          curl 127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags  →  llama3.2:3b   (D-13 16-GB tier)
Dashboard/API health: 127.0.0.1:8590/health  →  status=ok, version=2.3.0,
                                                models=278, correction_rules=3
Postgres container:   docker ps  →  mining-guardian-db, 127.0.0.1:5432->5432
No old-host TCP:      lsof -i @100.110.87.1     →  NO_OLD_HOST_TCP   (ROBS-PC)
                      lsof -i @187.124.247.182  →  NO_OLD_HOST_TCP   (VPS)
                      lsof -i @100.106.123.83   →  NO_OLD_HOST_TCP   (VPS Tailscale)
```

### Catalog row counts captured (parity caveat — see HANDOFF)

```
manufacturers   = 17
miner_models    = 324
model_aliases   = 101    # diverges from older 14338 baseline; captured as
                         # follow-up parity review — does NOT block green state
                         # because dashboard health endpoint reports models=278
                         # and the catalog importer is operating without errors
contributors    = 4
field_registry  = 75
sources         = 23
```

See `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2026-05-08.md` "Catalog parity caveat"
under the 2026-05-09 addendum for the full reasoning. The next
session should reconcile expected vs observed and update the
canonical baseline, but the gates that matter for green state
(scanner exit, Qwen accumulation, no-traffic to old hosts) all
passed cleanly.

### Status of earlier packages

- `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-53eac9397f00.pkg` — **CURRENT, OPERATIONAL
  ON MINI.** Do not rebuild over.
- `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-e3461260af2a.pkg` — superseded by the
  53eac9397f00 build before being installed on the Mini. Lacks
  P-037. Keep on disk as audit trail only; do not install.
- `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-2b41764a121b.pkg` — was operational on the
  Mini until the 53eac9397f00 install today. Lacks P-036 + P-037.
  Keep on disk as audit trail only; do not install.
- `MiningGuardian-1.0.3-eecde3a94c5b.pkg` — three PRs behind. Audit
  trail only; do not install.

### Apple notary submissions chronology

| Submission ID | Pkg | Built from | Status | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (earlier) | eecde3a94c5b | post-P-031 | Accepted | superseded; audit trail only |
| (2b41764) | 2b41764a121b | post-P-035 | Accepted | superseded after 53eac9397f00 install |
| (e3461260) | e3461260af2a | post-P-036 | Accepted | superseded by 53eac9397f00 before Mini install |
| `de02bda6-c1a2-4540-98df-3304cf7a71c2` | **53eac9397f00** | **post-P-037 (current)** | **Accepted** | **OPERATIONAL ON MINI** |

### Forward caution

- **Do not regenerate, delete, or modify** the build artifact at
  `build/MiningGuardian-1.0.3-53eac9397f00.pkg` or its sidecar.
  They are the audit trail for the currently-installed Mini binary.
- **Do not decommission VPS or ROBS-PC** until the operator
  completes the controlled shutdown window (optional ROBS-PC
  research-data dump + deliberate power-off). All four passover-
  audit gates passed live on the Mini today, but the controlled-
  shutdown step is operator-driven, not automated.
