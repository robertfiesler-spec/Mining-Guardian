# Mining Guardian — Repair Log

**Purpose:** A running record of bugs, misunderstandings, and fixes. Written in plain English, not dev-speak, so either of us can read it at any point and quickly understand what was broken and why. Every entry has four parts: what Bobby thought the program was doing, what it was actually doing, what we changed, and how we verified the change worked.

**How to use this file:**
- Add a new entry at the top of the "Entries" section every time we find a mismatch between design and reality, or every time we fix a real bug.
- Don't delete old entries. They're the institutional memory. Future Claude sessions read this to avoid rediscovering the same things.
- If an entry has follow-up work (like "still need to verify in production tomorrow"), add a `**Status:**` line at the bottom of the entry and update it when done.
- Each entry gets a date and a short title. Titles should pass the "could a stranger find this in 10 seconds" test.

**Sister documents:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — binding rules for every Claude session
- `docs/VISION.md` — canonical single-source-of-truth plan
- `README.md` — current architecture reference
- `AI_ROADMAP.md` — forward-looking priority queue
- `docs/SESSION_LOG_YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily narrative of each working session
- `docs/DAILY_DEEP_DIVE_DESIGN.md` — design doc for the daily Qwen deep dive pipeline
- **This file** — backward-looking "what went wrong, what we fixed, what we learned"

### 2026-04-10 (evening) · Hourly LLM was repeating the same analysis every scan — not learning

**What Bobby thought the program was doing:**
The hourly LLM should be learning and evolving. Each scan should find NEW patterns, note what CHANGED, and avoid repeating the same analysis over and over. The system should get smarter over time.

**What was actually happening:**
The LLM was storing its analyses to `knowledge.json['llm_scan_analyses']`, but it **never read them back**. Every hour it analyzed from scratch with no memory of what it said before. Result: the same miners got flagged with the same recommendations over and over — "miner 53517 offline, restart it" repeated for days.

**Why it mattered:**
- The LLM wasn't learning from itself
- Operator got spammed with the same recommendations repeatedly
- No sense of progression ("this was flagged 5 times, it's probably hardware")
- Defeats the purpose of an intelligent learning system

**What we changed:**
Modified `scripts/local_llm_analyzer.py`:

1. **Added previous analyses to context:**
   ```python
   prev_analyses = knowledge.get("llm_scan_analyses", [])[-3:]  # Last 3
   ```

2. **Added new prompt section:**
   ```
   --- YOUR PREVIOUS ANALYSES (3) ---
   Here's what you said in recent scans. DO NOT REPEAT THIS.
   Focus on what's CHANGED or NEW since then:
   ```

3. **Updated SUMMARY instruction:**
   ```
   What's CHANGED since the last scan? Any NEW trends?
   If nothing changed, say "Fleet stable, no changes" and move on.
   ```

4. **Added anti-repetition rule:**
   ```
   CRITICAL: Do NOT repeat the same analysis as previous scans.
   If you've already flagged a miner multiple times and nothing has changed,
   just note "still pending" and move on. Your job is to find NEW patterns.
   ```

**How we verified:**
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/local_llm_analyzer.py` passes
- Committed as `49a5740`

**Lesson:**
An AI system that stores data but never reads it back is NOT learning. The feedback loop has to be closed — outputs must become inputs for the next cycle. This was a fundamental architecture miss.

**Status:** Fixed. Next hourly scan should show different behavior — focusing on changes rather than repeating.

### 2026-04-10 (evening) · LLM kept recommending HVAC inspection + repeating 20-min cooldown rule

**What Bobby thought the program was doing:**
The LLM should NOT recommend HVAC inspection — the HVAC is working correctly. Low delta-T is normal and seasonal. Also, once the system learns a rule (like the 20-minute post-restart cooldown), it shouldn't keep mentioning it in every single report.

**What was actually happening:**
1. **HVAC recommendations:** The LLM kept saying "review HVAC system to address environmental overheating concerns"
2. **Repeating OPERATOR LEARNING:** Every report included the same 20-minute cooldown rule

**What we changed:**
1. Added explicit HVAC disclaimer: "HVAC is WORKING CORRECTLY. Do NOT recommend HVAC inspection."
2. Updated OPERATOR LEARNING to only show for NEW denials with NEW reasons
3. Added warning: "The 20-minute cooldown rule is ALREADY KNOWN — do not repeat it."

**Status:** Fixed. Committed as `45b954f`.

### 2026-04-10 (evening) · daily_collect_logs.py called collect_logs() with no arguments

**What Bobby thought the program was doing:**
The 1pm cron job should download logs from all miners with a retry pass for failures.

**What was actually happening:**
The script called `mg.collect_logs()` with no arguments, but the method requires `miners` and `issues`.

**What we changed:**
Script now fetches miners from AMS first: `mg.collect_logs(miners=mg.ams.get_miners(), issues=[])`

**Status:** Fixed. Committed as `8186900`. Tomorrow's 1pm cron will be the first test.

### 2026-04-10 (afternoon) · Three silent bugs: bad insight, broken cron, missing confidence

**What was wrong:**
1. Claude generated `chain_3_voltage_failure_hydro` — S19JPro only has 3 boards, not 4
2. Cron job called `MiningGuardian()` without config argument
3. Import was `from confidence_scorer` but file is at `ai/confidence_scorer.py`

**What we changed:**
1. Deleted the bad insight
2. Created proper wrapper script
3. Fixed import path

**Hardware facts established:**
- S19JPro: 3 boards (Chain 0, 1, 2)
- AH3880 Auradine: 2 boards only

**Status:** Fixed. Commits `7382037`, `8186900`.

### 2026-04-10 · Hourly scans showing procurement advice instead of operational patterns

**What was wrong:**
All insights dumped into hourly prompts — including "REJECT" and "KEEP" which are strategic.

**What we changed:**
Filter by action type: OPERATIONAL (TUNE/WATCH/INVESTIGATE) for hourly, STRATEGIC (REJECT/KEEP) for weekly.

**Status:** Fixed. Committed as `f04d703`.
